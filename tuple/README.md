Tuples
Tuples are immutable sequences that can store a collection of items. 
Tuples have a few built-in methods that you can use to manipulate them.

Count()
It is used to determine how many times a specific value appears in the tuple. 
It returns an integer representing the number of occurrences of that value.

Index()
It is used to find the first occurrence of a specified value within the tuple. 
It returns the index (position) of the first occurrence of that value. 
If the value is not found, it raises a ValueError.
