Set 
Set is an unordered collection of unique elements. 
Sets are mutable, meaning we can add or remove items after the set has been created. 
The built-in `set` type provides several methods that allow us to perform various operations on sets.

Add()
It is used to add a single element to a set. 
If the element already exists in the set, the add() method will not add it again, as sets do not allow duplicate elements.

Clear() 
It is used to remove all elements from a set. 
After calling this method, the set will be empty.

Copy() 
It is used to create a shallow copy of a set. 
This means that it creates a new set that contains the same elements as the original set, but changes made to the new set will not affect the original set, and vice versa.
